Run linters against changed git files and don't let :poop: slip into your code base!

## Credit

This repository is almost complete copy of Andrey's (@okonet) lint-staged repo
https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged

The only difference - is that this package also lints files, that were modified, but not yet added to commit.
Which is realized by using changed-git-files, instead of staged-git-files package.

This makes it useful when you want to lint your files before event.
